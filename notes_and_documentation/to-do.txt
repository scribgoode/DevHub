my profile
1. render page
2. dm list should be everyone but the user
3. able to send message after clicking on dm list buttons

send Logic
disable send button until
    create socket to server based on dm list buttons
    enable send button once socket is created

other profile
1. render page
2. no dm list - just chatbox
3. if first time sender
        chatbox = empty
        after send message
        chatbox is updated
    else
        chatbox should populate with chat history

Bugs
1. message sending more than once (FIXED)
2. message sending to user is not saving

to-do
1. scroll feature - chat overflow
2. timestamps on messages
