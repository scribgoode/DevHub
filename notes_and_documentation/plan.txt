To Do List Before Production:
    Security
    -make sure each form has csrf token
    -look up django security practices and implement standards

    UI
    -configure css for smart phones
    -upon connection to the site, play a slideshow that shows you how to effectively use the site(make this easily accesible)
    -after the slide show require a sign in or sign up to access the site
    -after the account is created, the person should be directed to a seperate page where they can decide to stay a recruit or advertise a project or multiple projects and to record their elevator pitch
    -give people a good example of an elevator pitch and some key points to talk about and emphasize the importance of it
    -configure css for sign out page
    -notifcation across top of all screens that says you have a meeting that start 1 hour before meeting and during meeting(link if text or video meeting)
    -consider order of information in the rows on the home page
    -pick friendly font

    Video Chat
    -✔️add microphone button
    -only make video chat accessible during the time of the meeting and during video chat meetings
    -✔️include important information on this page
    
    Meetings
    -only let people cancel meetings 24 hours before without getting a strike
    -simple meeting reports from both people after meeting(maybe allow each person to see their own meeting reports they filled out)

    User Profiles Page
    -maybe add meeting statistics for bottom right of profile page(something needs to go in that bottom right corner)

    Home Page
    -✔️add real time search
    -✔️display last online(online within the last week, online within the past month)(filter)(we decided there was no point for this filter right now)
    -display currently online using websocket
    -pagination
    -footer
    -default sorting
    -logo
    -render projects on home page(the current project box contains "Project 1: Fornite", etc.)(on hover all project information is shown)
    -✔️elevator pitch filter
    -✔️meeting preference filter
    -✔️stackable filters and search with filters applied notification

    Text Chat
    -make sure people will only be added to contacts once they send a meeting request(chat is opened at this point but if the other person declines the meeting, only they can message the person and have the choice to remove that person from their contacts)
    -make it possible to access someones profile from contacts page in messages
    -add feature to search contacts
    -notifcation on the contact name that says how many new message you have from them(1 new message)
    -notification on the message icon that states how many total new messages you have
    -time stamps and date stamps

    My Profile Page
    -✔️allow edits to only some profile information
    -need to be sure do add something like display projects with dates and links so people can show off their past projects
    -can only switch to creator status if you have at least one project displaying
    -if your status is recuit, state and display the type of projects you are open to joining(maybe do this for creators to, maybe for creators state whether they are open to contributing to another project)
    -add favorites list of profiles
    -display strikes
    -notifier that states whether someone is willing to contribute to someone elses project(default is yes)
    -remove sent meeting invites and provide a link to a meeting history page

    Signup Page
    -allow to select dob using calendar and change format(some type of library)
    -send code to email to verify email

    Signin Page
    -allow yourself to sign in with other sites such as google

    Meeting Point
    -make sure meeting point api cannot be exploited

    Projects
    -allow people a section to put links
    -allow an optional section where you can state how you want a person to contribute to the project
    -better logic for project display feature(improve public, private, and active)



Future Ideas and Add Ons
    -set up way to get emails/text messages if you get a new meeting invite
    -users can send the projects in the meeting request they are interested in joining/talking about
    -if a user hasnt logged in for a certain period maybe make all projects inactive
    -goals feature to display on profile(make money, improve collaboration, etc.)
    -option to do leetcode together on the site and competitive leetcode
    -code repository
    -work split percentages(50:50, 100:0)(sounds good in theory but will cause more tension)(also people dont actually know how willing they are to split work)
    -streaming capabilites with ability to save streams
    -pitch competitions
    -system to remove identifying information from display pages such as social media links(dont remove stuff like last name just links that could be seem as advertising)(give them just enough
    information so a person can do a criminal history search)
    Payment
        -user buys 3 meeting requests for 10$ to unlock everything other than the homepage with a certain amount blurred and personal profile, once they send a meeting request, one of the tokens
        is put in escrow. If the receiver accepts the meeting request token it is removed. If the meeting is declined we unlock one of the remaining meeting request tokens. Once you have 
        all of your tokens removed you are denied access to the site again. You probably should still have access even if all tokens are in escrow
    -project categories or pages that are fitted for a particular subject
    -features for recruiters if we notice recruiters
    -groups that cost money to mangage
    -way for users to pay for advertising on their project
    -paid projects tab(pay to post on this or access it)
    -prize for best project after multiple months(way to submit your project journey)
    -replit like capabilites
    -track times in meetings to save as a metric for project progress
    -coffee chat project(a way for people to just talk about their careers thus far and get to know one another)
    -***private feature(allow you to have projects that you want to have hidden on your page with specific tags)(we have a button attached to the projects that when clicked takes user 
    to another profile and displays their hidden project with the same tag)(maybe use nlp/statistical model to help users put in the right 
    descriptions for their projects)(maybe you just want to be more private too)
    -project management software
    -screen share in video call
    


Business Developement
    -define target market(most likely software engineers but maybe we can do them, influencers, entreprenuers, interviewers, etc)
    -recruiting business
    -work with wework
    -makret to youtubers for a way for people to gain extras in their youtube vids








---------------------------------------------------------------everything below this is before the 3/14/25 rewrite of this file--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mission
-bring together all engineers not just software developers

NEXT STEPS:
-merge text and video chat, make sure the site can have multiple rooms of text and video chat, ringing notification
-read about django testing and implement testing for the models
-have logic to send a specifc type of meeting request
-proposed meeting spot algorithm
-search and filtering
-prevent api call spam -> django_ratelimit
-calendar system/meeting request list
-payment system
-make ui seemless and pretty
-invision secnarious and implement proper pay walls and access walls
-prepare terraform file, create docker, migrate database, push to aws
-test and set up our own accounnts
-bring users to site/advertise and gage retention and brainstorm whats need to make website more seemless and friendly


Key features
-profiles
    1.60 second pitch about you(highly recommened for greater chance of connecting)
    2.status: creator or recruit
    3.if creator: current projects, preferences on collarborating = hybrid, in-person, online
    4.city
    5.online notifier


Core functionalities
-possible meet up spots halfway between(coffee shops, libraries, wework)

Signup:
email/password/dob
to request or join stream meeting must finish required profile fields(this also lets you switch to creator status)


MVP
-devhub.io(this is likely going to be too expensive) or projectpal.io($32/yr on hostinger)(be careful searching domains because they probably increase the price based on hitcount) or developercentral.io
-profile/account(change and add)✔️(add last_online attribute to engineer model)
-dm system✔️
-friends list✔️
-search and filtering✔️
-live chat system✔️
-proposed meeting spot algorithm 
-meetings/simple calendar page✔️
-rating system/strike system
-something to buy(payment when request to meet is accepted?)
-once someone accepts a meeting invation you two become collaborators(messaging and video calling only become available once two people are collaborators)
-only show the elevator pitch and current projects(basically undentifiable information(censor name in elevator pitch using ai))(to encourage people to meet in person might not pay for meeting invite if they request that type of meeting)
-extensive testing on just functionality for now
-advertising plan
-people pay for access after they send three meeting invites they pay for access again(pay wall everything except home page and profile page)(be ready to remove links to personal information pages such as linked in, instagram, and even phone number)
-meeting reports and selling ratings to recruiters


FUTURE IDEAS
-if you sign up for a commited meeting you have to go or you get a strike(reliability score)
-repository
-replit
-kids version
-option to do leetcode probs together on site
-pitch competitions/meetups
-youtube coding interviews and skits on the platform to advertise

THINGS TO FIX:
-need to add address and meeting prefernce information to user model, send email to users email when they get a meeting request or a message

1st Payment Window
-user clicks on send meeting request
-right after they are prompted to customize their meeting request and before submiting are told that five dollars will be charged when and if the other user accepts the invitation
-after the meeting request is sent, all hidden information about that user is revealed and chat capabilites are unlocked
-the user who accepts the invite can be given a strike if they do not show up to the meeting without canceling 24 hours prior, however the sender cannot due to them spending money
-all users videos need to be scanned by ai to remove names until after someone pays to have a meeting with them
(THIS METHOD IS LIKELY GOING TO BE TOO EXPLOITABLE BUT THERE SHOULD BE SOME SORT OF INCENTIVE TO PAY BY THE PERSON TO ENSURE RELIABILITY ON BOTH ENDS)

maybe add case study tab like successstory.com

video chat feature logic
-button beside send that says call(call can only be used if during there meeting time)
-a pop up window shows up on the other users screen sayin that the user is calling
-yes redirects them to their chat room(each personjoins the chat room and sees the others information)(the video cameras are placed above all the other information)


Filtering
-filter people by uploaded elevator pitch

Webscokets and WebRTC
-we need to be careful when launching this because i am not sure exactly if we are supposed to create a new web socket everytime or if its supposed to be like one websocket that everyone can connect to(ive been reading that 
you can accrue a lot of costs from opening a lot of websocket connections)(make sure we have llc set up)
-just found out you only need one websocket endpoint(however need one for text chat and need one for video chat)
-should i only have one websocket connection text_chat and video_chat? or a websocket endpoint for both (just one for both now that handles message and webrtc)

UI Buffs
-make projects on my profile where you can add multiple projects, the project you want to display, the projects you want to show on your profile, and the ability to add people to projects
-ability to favorite profiles incase you want to send a meeting request to them later
-work ratio instead of creator and recruit(e.g 100%/0, 50%/50%, 75%/25%)(willing to ....)(or not because now its starting to feel like a negotiation and negotiations arent friendly)
-after the account is created, the person should be directed to a seperate page where they can decide to stay a recruit or advertise a project or multiple projects and to record their elevator pitch
-maybe add meeting statistics for bottom right of profile page
-need to be sure do add something like display projects with dates and links so people can show off their past projects
-need pages for software engineers, influencers, entreprenuers?, researchers?
